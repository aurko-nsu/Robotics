# Robotics
This repository contains a few codes that I have written and used in various robotics and projects.

  1. <a href="https://github.com/aurko-nsu/Robotics/tree/master/Disinfection%20System">Disinfection System</a><br>
    It's one of my solo project. This code was written for "Disinfection System" project that will cover up all the factors which can transmit the viruses from person to person.
    <br><strong>Working procedure of this code:</strong> A specific chamber will automatically sanitize and check the current body temperature of a subject body. 
    After to identify the subject an automated RF scanner will ask to swap subject's ID to complete the verification process. 
    Followed by the verification an automated camera will turn on and detect and recognize the subject's face is covered with mask or not. 
    Positive results will open the gate and remain close if not. 
    All of these data will be stored in a cloud database to track the person's status in a regular basis.
    
   
    
 2. <a href="https://github.com/aurko-nsu/Robotics/tree/master/IoT%20and%20Computer%20Vision%20based%20Electronic%20Voting%20System">IoT and Computer Vision based Electronic Voting System</a><br>
    This is my undegrad thesis project which is available <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-981-15-4409-5_56">here</a>.
    <br><strong>Working procedure of this code:</strong> Identification and verification of voters are assured by microchip embedded national identity (NID) card and biometric fingerprint 
    technology, which is unique for every single voter. Also, with the help of live image processing technology, this system becomes more secure and effective. while voting if         multiple faces detected by the camera module of the voting machine, automatically the vote will not be counted. Violaâ€“Jones algorithm for face detection and local binary           pattern histogram (LBPH) algorithm for face recognition has begun the image preparing innovation increasingly exact and faster. Four connected machines work together to           accumulate each successful vote in this system.
